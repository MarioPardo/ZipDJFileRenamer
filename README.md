<b>If you run into issues doing this (like version stuff)</b>
 1) Simply download "App.java" into some folder

## How to Use
Make sure you have a folder in which all the files (and only files to be renamed) are stored.
This will likely the the extracted folder from the zip file you downloaded.
Simply select the folder in which the files you want to be renamed are, click "RenameFiles", and boom!
