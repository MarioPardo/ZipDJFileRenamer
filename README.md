## How to Run

Simply running "RenameFiles.exe" should work. 
### Mac:
 1) Download "RenameFiles.jar"
 2) Open a terminal on the folder in which the file was downloaded
 3) enter "java -jar RenameFiles.jar"

## How to Use
Make sure you have a folder in which all the files (and only files to be renamed) are stored.
